# Rythmv2.0
### A one day project: a bot that connects to discord and plays music for the everyone in the voice channel

Often when chatting to friends over discord we like to listen to music together via a bot that plays songs for the whole channel. We used to use Rythm which was great until they had to shut down. Other alternatives were a bit buggy and I thought I may as well make one myself.
This is just a simple bot that searches youtube for a song and streams it to a discord voice channel, it can also queue, skip and stop songs. 
*Potentially more features to come...*
