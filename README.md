# Rythmv2.0
### A bot that connects to discord and plays music for the everyone in the voice channel

Often when chatting to friends over discord we like to listen to music together via a bot that plays songs for the whole channel. We used to use Rythm which worked great until they had to shut down due to copyright problems with youtube. Other alternatives were a bit buggy and I thought I may as well make one myself.
This is just a simple half day project that searches youtube for a song and streams it to a discord voice channel. 
*Potentially more features to come...*
